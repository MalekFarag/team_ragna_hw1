<h1>Team Ragna!</h1>
	<h2>Team member #1: <br>
	Malek Farag</h2> <br>
	<p>Hey! I'm Malek. I'm 18 years old. I was born and raised here, in London. Though, I'm half french and half arabic. <br>Some of my interests are soccer, music and video games. I've been playing soccer since a very young age. I love the sport! Music and video games provide peace to my semi-stressful life. It's nice to kick back, place some games and listen to some tunes after a long day.</p>

	Cindy Mena</h2> <br>
	<p>Hello my name is Cindy Mena. I’m from El Salvador. I recently move to Canada and I’m loving it. 
I graduated as a graphic designer in 2011. I like to watch movies on my spread time and also going out and spend time with friends. <br>I like being outdoors enjoying the scenery of this place. And I’m so glad to be part of Ragna – the most amazing team!
